Code with added questions

#1. Uncomment the compound_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins two independent clauses, using a conjunction.  
#2. Uncomment the complex_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins a dependent and an independent clause.
#3. Uncomment the compound_complex_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins a dependent clause with an independent clause, a conjunction, and an independent clause.
